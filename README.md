# Guild Lottery for *Newbie Love*

A random number generator that uses four parameters for seed generation (a custom string, a random color, a random GW2 item name, a random GW2 mini name).

## How to run:
* Open https://hugobert.github.io/gw2love-lottery
* Enter all the participants
* Enter a magic word
* ...
* Profit!

## How to verify:
You participated. You lost. Now you're salty and want to blame Buns.
Cry no more - just enter the seed along with all the participants on [the validation site](https://hugobert.github.io/gw2love-lottery/validate.html) - it uses the same algorithm and should return the winner of that round.


The seed looks something like this:

`Lolipizza #9F8666 Strong Rawhide Shoulders Mini Zaishen Warrior`

If the validator says you won, but Buns says you didn't, then you can blame him :)
