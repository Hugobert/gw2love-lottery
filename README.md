# Guild Lottery for *Newbie Love*

A random number generator that uses four parameters for seed generation (a custom string, a random color, a random GW2 item name, a random GW2 mini name).

## How to run:
* Open https://hugobert.github.io/gw2love-lottery/
* Enter all the participants
* Enter a magic word
* ...
* Profit!

## How to verify:
You participated. You lost. Now you're salty and want to blame Buns.
Cry no more - just enter the seed along with all the participants on [the validation site](https://hugobert.github.io/gw2love-lottery/validate.html) - it uses the same algorithm and should return the winner of that round. The seed has to be passed in the url, like this: [validate.html#!/seed-goes-here](https://hugobert.github.io/gw2love-lottery/validate.html#!/W1tbIkZyb2RvIiwic2tpZGFkZGxlIl0sWyJTYW0iLCJza2lkb29kbGUiXV0sMTMwLDczMDk0LDM3Ml0=) (the lottery itself will prodive a link to the validator as soon as a winner has been determined)

If the validator says you won, but Buns says you didn't, then you can blame him :)
